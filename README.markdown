# FireBIEST

## Developer-kit plugin for [Stud.IP](http://www.studip.de)

With this plugin you can:

* check your javascript (either core or of plugins) with jslint
* create for your plugins unit-tests in simpletest and test them via browser within the Stud.IP
* let highlight html that may be irritating to persons with screenreader, so you can create barrier-free code.
* have a look at the database without having a PhpMyAdmin installed on server.
